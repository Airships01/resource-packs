# RuneScape 3 Resource Pack for Runelite

## Description

As an individual who cares about UI/UX, ever since I discovered the Resource Pack plugin I wanted to create a RS3-inspired UI that feels responsive and intuitive when using it. 

While there were an abundance of RS3 assets already available, nearly all of them had to be resized or reworked to fit the Old School RS interface dimensions.

Each sprite in this pack was created from the highest quality source material available and resizing was done using the CubicSpline algorithm as this produced the best results for downscaling.

## Tools

#### Tools used during the creation of this pack
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Image processing tool.
* [Imagemagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) - Bulk image processing tool and resizing with CubicSpline algorithm.
* [Optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) - Lossless PNG compression.
