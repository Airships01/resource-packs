The ideal (and hopefully final) dark theme for OSRS.

The old Dark mode resource packs on the hub are many versions out of date so I went and fixed them and tweaked some things to make it more vanilla-like. Basically updated it for Combat Achievements and Group Ironman; changed the XP drops button and made the Arceuus spellbook appear consistent compared to the other spellbooks. Also fixed the settings UI. Other packs made before 1.4.0 seemingly have their sliders broken.
