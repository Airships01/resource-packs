## Known bugs/issues:

- When you get poisoned or venomed, your HP icon will reset to vanilla sprites due to a conflict with "Poison" plugin, to fix this
  simply turn off "Change HP Orb Icon" tab from the plugin.

- Prayer, Magic spells and Emote icons are still vanilla style, as I cannot change those. I have requested the author of the base plugin
  to make them replaceable but not everything always works out, lets just wait!
